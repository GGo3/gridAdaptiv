        <aside class="text-content"><marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left">Harold is a recurring character in many Fallout games. He originally was a vault dweller from Vault 29 until he left in 2090, and went to live in the Hub's Oldtown around 2161 and in Gecko around 2241, and thus met both the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One. He then traveled to the Capital Wasteland where the tree growing out of his head took root, forming Oasis by 2277. He's been sedentary for so long that he's become bored of life and has lost much of his will to live. Although his horrible mutations look like that of any normal ghoul, there is more to Harold than meets the eye.</marquee></aside>
